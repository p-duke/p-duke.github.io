    <p>Trail running is an endurance sport which consists of running and hiking over trails. It differs from road running and racing on the track because trail running takes place on hiking trails, often in mountainous terrain, where there can be much larger ascents and descents. It is difficult to definitively distinguish trail running from cross country running.
    The amount of organized trail races has grown exponentially over the past few years throughout the world, now over 20 trail runs in the Bay Area. Runners often cite less impact stress compared to road running, as well as the landscape and non-urban environment, as primary reasons for preferring trail running. This move to nature is also reflected in large increase in competitors in non-traditional/off-road triathlons and in adventure racing over the past five years.</p>
